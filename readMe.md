# Firebase Assignment - Train Scheduler (Basic - Recommended)

* Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
  * In the form below, administrators are be able to submit the following
    
    * Train Name
    
    * Destination 
    
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  
  * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
  * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
